# Welcome to Sup3rcuts

A react based Application that brings fighting game players together that have a passion for a specific Street Fighter game in particular, 3rd Strike!

Our small community cherishes the value of offline play in an online world. When game consoles first offered the chance to play others from around the world, local arcades suffered from loss of cilental and almost all of them were closed. Our goal is to prove to FGC(Fighting Game Community) that offline play still has value and were here to make it big again!

Sup3rcuts has grown from a group of 30 players to a strong community of over 200 hundred street fighters! This Web-based Application will help build our mark that we are still invovled with offline play and the value of learning from face-to-face player interaction that built the arcade empire years before.

Through event-planning and live streams every weekend, we reach out to players through facebook, instagram, twitch, and Discord servers. Reaching as far as the east coast, we have support coming in like never before! 

The weekly events that take place every Saturday night can vary from casual sit in plays, to group fights ranging from 3v3's to as big as 6v6's, 1v1 First to 10's, and full out prize based tournaments! Our hardware is just as impressive as our trained players. We utilize 1ms Asus computer monitors to run StreetFighter 3rd Strike O.E Edtion on the PS# and Xbox360 platforms, as well as 2 fullsize arcade cabinets that run 3rd strike on Superguns!

This application is designed to bring all of the various platforms that spread out the player basis from following us from app too app. Combining the forum ideas and real time player interaction, sharing game tips and tricks, upcoming announcements, commenting on various posts, designing your own player cards(profile cards), staying upto date with current events, being updated with "off-site" group based get-togethers, and much much more too come!
